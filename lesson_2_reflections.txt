	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a hidden file named .git is created to hold the history of the files.
You need to do it to create this .git to make it into a repository, or else it would be just a regular file.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory as it is just a place where the current state 
of the file is saved to be later on saved into the repository as a commit.  They all contain the same files, however,
the staging area is stage 2 of creating commit, while working directory is 1 and repository is 3.  The things
inside the staging area comes from the working directory, and is later on pushed to the repository.

It offers the value that you get to chose which items to commit together.
